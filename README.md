# About project

Make a program to read data from N contributors (N entered by the user), which
they can be a natural person or a legal entity, and then show the amount of tax paid by each one,
as well as the total tax collected.

Individual: persons whose income was below 20000.00 pay 15% tax. people with
income from 20000.00 onwards pay 25% tax. If the person had health expenses, 50%
of these expenses are deducted from the tax.
Example: a person whose income was 50000.00 and had 2000.00 in health expenses, the tax
stays: (50000 * 25%) - (2000 * 50%) = 11500.00
Legal entity: legal entities pay 16% tax. However, if the company has more than 10
employees, she pays 14% tax.
Example: a company whose income was 400000.00 and has 25 employees, the tax is:
400000 * 14% = 56000.0
